# General

Same idea of [this version in Julia](https://github.com/andreterceiro/game-of-consecutive-mathematical-operations-julia), but in Kotlin.

You need to use this commands to generate the bytecode and execute it. If you will use a wrapper(like k.php), maybe an error occurs

```
kotlinc -include-runtime filename.kt -d filename.jar
java -jar filename.jar
```

**Is obvious that you will need to replace "filename" by your file name (with no extension), ok?**

[Elixir version](https://github.com/andreterceiro/game-of-consecutive-mathematical-operations-elixir).
